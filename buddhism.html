  <div> <p> <strong> Buddhism </strong> is a religion and philosophy based off the teachings of the Buddha, a teacher who lived in
    northern India between the 6-4 centuries BCE whose real name was Siddhartha Gautama.
    It has played a central role in the spiritual, social, and cultural life of Asia, and more recently in the West during the 20-21 centuries.
  </p> </div>
  <br>

  <div> Within Buddhism, there is a Triratna ("Three Jewels", or the Threefold Refuge), consisting of Buddha (the teacher), dharma (the teaching, or
    doctrine),
    and sangha (the monastic order, or community). There are also Four Noble Truths that are considered to be the essence of the teachings of the
    Buddha. He developed these four principles during his legendary meditation under the bodhi tree.  </div>
    <h3 id="truths"> Four Noble Truths:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="truth1"> Dukkha (the truth of suffering)</li>

  <p>
    <div> One of the central beliefs in Buddhism is the belief that the universe is the product of karma, or the law of the cause
   and effects of actions, and that there is a cycle of rebirth, called samsara (literally "wandering"), which is regarded
     as a domain of suffering. A Buddhist's ultimate goal is to escape from that suffering, but the means of escape will
     only be revealed after many lifetimes, when they perfect themselves to the point where they discover the path out of samsara. </div>
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3 id="sects"> Sects </h3>
  <div> There are three major branches of Buddhism: Theravada ("Way of the Elders"), Mahayana (Sanskrit: "Greater Vehicle"),
   and Vajrayana (Sanskrit: "Diamond Vehicle").</div>
   <br>
  <div> The <b> Theravada </b> branch teaches about karma, as well as the usage of meditation to achieve their goal of liberation from disturbances.
    These teachings mainly proliferated in Southeast Asia (Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma). </div>
    <br>
  <div> The <b> Mahayana </b> branch teaches the Bodhisattva Attitude, or a mindset in which a person's primary motivation in life is to be useful
    to others, and aims to gradually increase both compassion and wisdom. These teachings mainly spread through Northern Asia (Japan, Vietnam, China,
    Tibet, and Korea). The Mahayana includes Theravada teachings. </div>
    <br>
  <div> In <b> Vajrayana </b>, the Buddha is not considered to be a person but rather a mirror to every person's mind. People who are part of this
    branch believe that external perfection can only be achieved once they have innate internal perfection. When Buddhism was eradicated in its native
    land, these teachings mainly survived only in Tibet. The Vajrayana includes both Theravada and Mahayana teachings. </div>

    <h3 id="holidays"> Holidays:</h3>
    <div> There are many Buddhist holidays, but two important ones are Vesak and Magha Puja. </div>
    <br>
    <div> <b> <strong> Vesak </strong> </b>  is on the day of the Buddha's birthday and is one of the major festivals of the year. It is celebrated on the
      day of the first full moon in </div>
    <div>  May, or during the fourth lunar month that occurs during May or June. In some countries, Vesak is a day on which people also
      celebrate the enlightenment of the Buddha.  </div>
      <br>
    <div> <b> <strong> Magha Puja </strong> </b> is an important religious festival celebrated in Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos on the day of the full moon
      during the third lunar month (usually in February or March). It celebrates a gathering that was held by the Buddha and 1,250 of his first
      disciples.  </div>
